## 🚀 Vision & Design Philosophy

The website is designed with a **"Classic Modernist"** aesthetic, blending the timeless elegance of the **Georgia Serif** typeface with cutting-edge web technologies and **Material Design** principles.

- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle translucency and backdrop blurs create a sophisticated layered depth.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: An interactive "Red Smoke" water ripple effect on the canvas provides a unique, engaging background.
- **Micro-Animations**: Purposeful, scroll-triggered animations (reveals, scales, and slides) guide the user through the narrative.
- **Soothing Theme**: A carefully curated color palette featuring desaturated reds and deep grays for a "Premium Tech" feel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Foundational**: Semantic HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Design System with Variables).
- **Interactivity**: Vanilla JavaScript (Intersection Observer API for animations, Canvas API for ripple effect).
- **Icons & Typography**: Font Awesome 6.4, Georgia Serif.
- **Performance**: Zero external library dependencies (except icons), ensuring lightning-fast load times.
- **SEO**: Structured data (JSON-LD), optimized Open Graph tags, and keyword-rich meta descriptions.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Intelligent theme switching with persistent user preference (stored in `localStorage`).
- **Interactive Timeline**: A responsive vertical timeline chronicling 13+ years of professional growth.
- **Expertise Grid**: Categorized skill tags with interactive hover states.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully optimized for all screen sizes, featuring a native-feeling mobile navigation menu.
- **SEO-Ready**: Optimized for indexing on Google and Bing to align personal branding across platforms like LinkedIn.
- **Project Showcases**: Includes interactive projects like the [Lucky Person Picker](http://rakeshandrotula.co.in/lucky-person/) and [Coin Toss](https://rakeshandrotula.co.in/coin-toss/).
